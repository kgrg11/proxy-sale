## What Makes Proxy-Sale Stand Out?

Here's the thing about proxy services - most of them promise the moon and deliver a rock. Proxy-Sale is different. After more than 10 years in the business, they've figured out what actually matters: speed, reliability, and real human support when things go sideways.

Their network spans over 200 countries with access to 400+ networks and 1,000+ subnets. That's not just impressive on paper - it means you're getting genuine diversity in IP addresses, which is crucial if you're trying to avoid blocks or need specific geographic targeting.

The speed is where things get interesting. We're talking up to 1 Gbps bandwidth on datacenter proxies. That's fast enough to handle serious data scraping operations without making you want to pull your hair out waiting for responses.

## Proxy Types: Pick Your Perfect Match

Proxy-Sale doesn't do the one-size-fits-all thing. They offer five distinct proxy types, each designed for specific use cases:

### IPv4 Datacenter Proxies

These are your workhorses - fast, reliable, and compatible with pretty much everything on the internet. Starting at just $0.72 per IP for a 7-day rental, they're perfect for general browsing, social media management, and web scraping tasks that don't require residential-grade anonymity.

### IPv6 Proxies

If you need massive scalability on a budget, IPv6 is your friend. At $0.07 per IP, these are among the cheapest proxies you'll find. The catch? Not every website supports IPv6 yet, but for those that do, you're getting incredible value.

### ISP Proxies

Now we're getting fancy. ISP proxies blend datacenter speed with residential-style legitimacy. They're issued by actual internet service providers but hosted on server infrastructure, giving you the best of both worlds. At $1.35 per IP, they're ideal for account creation, traffic arbitrage, and bypassing tough geo-restrictions.

### Mobile Proxies

These use real 4G/5G/LTE connections from mobile carriers. Because they share IP pools with actual mobile devices, websites treat them like regular users. Starting at $14 per IP (for 2-day rentals), they're pricier but worth every penny for social media automation and multi-account management.

### Residential Proxies

The crème de la crème of anonymity. These IPs come from real home internet connections, making them virtually indistinguishable from regular users. Priced at $0.70 per GB with coverage in 200+ countries, they're your go-to for competitive intelligence, price monitoring, and accessing the most protected platforms.

## Pricing That Makes Sense

Let's talk money. Proxy-Sale's pricing is refreshingly straightforward - the more you buy, the more you save. Here's how it breaks down:

| Package Size | IPv4 Price (30 days) | Price Per IP | Discount |
|--------------|----------------------|--------------|----------|
| 1 IP | $1.65 | $1.65 | 0% |
| 10 IPs | $15.68 | $1.57 | 5% |
| 20 IPs | $30.36 | $1.52 | 8% |
| 50 IPs | $66.00 | $1.32 | 20% |
| 100 IPs | $123.75 | $1.24 | 25% |
| 200 IPs | $231.00 | $1.16 | 30% |
| 500 IPs | $495.00 | $0.99 | 40% |
| 1000 IPs | $957.00 | $0.96 | 42% |

The beauty here is flexibility. You can rent proxies for as little as 7 days or lock in for a full year. Longer commitments mean deeper discounts - up to 40% off if you go with the annual plans.

## Real Performance: Speed & Reliability

Look, anyone can claim their proxies are fast. Proxy-Sale backs it up with actual infrastructure. Their datacenter proxies deliver consistent 1 Gbps speeds with response times averaging under 0.8 seconds. The uptime sits around 99.9%, which means you're not dealing with constant connection drops.

The mobile proxies run on actual carrier networks with speeds between 3-30 Mbps depending on network conditions. That's real-world performance, not synthetic benchmarks.

For residential proxies, the success rate hovers around 99.5% - meaning your requests actually go through instead of getting blocked. That's significantly better than many competitors who barely crack 95%.

## Use Cases: What Can You Actually Do With These?

### Social Media Management

Running multiple Instagram, Facebook, or TikTok accounts? Mobile and residential proxies make it possible without getting flagged. Each account gets its own IP, mimicking real user behavior.

### Web Scraping & Data Collection

Need to extract data from e-commerce sites, search engines, or competitor websites? Residential and ISP proxies help you fly under the radar while collecting the information you need. The sticky session options let you maintain the same IP for extended periods.

### Gaming & Account Creation

Gamers use these for multi-boxing in games like Runescape, WoW, and Minecraft. The low latency and high speeds make for smooth gameplay even when running multiple instances.

### Ad Verification & Brand Protection

Residential proxies let you check how your ads appear in different regions, verify that partners are displaying content correctly, and catch fraud before it costs you money.

### Price Monitoring & E-commerce

Track competitor prices across different regions, monitor stock availability, and gather market intelligence without getting blocked by anti-bot systems.

## User Experience: What People Actually Say

Real user feedback from 2026 paints a mostly positive picture. People consistently praise:

- **Fast support responses** - usually under 60 seconds for live chat
- **Stable connections** - proxies that actually stay connected
- **Wide location coverage** - ability to target specific cities and states
- **Reasonable pricing** - competitive rates, especially for bulk orders

The complaints? Some users mention occasional connection issues during maintenance windows, and the lack of a free trial can be frustrating for those wanting to test before committing. However, there's a 24-hour refund policy that somewhat compensates for this.

One user put it well: "Pretty good service and wonderful prices. I use them primarily for web scraping and managing several accounts for different platforms. The proxies work well with no issues."

## Setup & Integration: Actually Pretty Easy

You don't need to be a tech wizard to get started. Proxy-Sale supports:

- Username/password authentication
- IP whitelisting
- HTTP(S) and SOCKS5 protocols
- API integration with detailed documentation
- Compatible with all major browsers, automation tools, and scrapers

The personal dashboard is intuitive enough that you can manage hundreds of proxies without getting lost. API support means you can automate proxy rotation, purchase, and configuration if you're running larger operations.

## Security & Compliance: The Legal Stuff

This matters more than you might think. Proxy-Sale sources their IPs through legitimate channels:

- Residential IPs from users who voluntarily participate in their network
- Direct partnerships with ISPs for ISP proxies
- Official agreements with mobile carriers for mobile proxies

They're compliant with GDPR, CCPA, and ISO/IEC 27001 standards. Everything is obtained legally and transparently, which means you're not unknowingly participating in sketchy practices.

## Payment Options: Multiple Ways to Pay

Flexibility extends to payment methods:

- Credit/debit cards (Visa, MasterCard)
- PayPal
- Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT, Litecoin)
- WebMoney
- Other regional payment processors

The crypto option is great if you value payment privacy or operate in regions with restricted financial services.

## The Rebranding: Proxy-Sale to Geonix

In July 2025, Proxy-Sale officially rebranded to Geonix. Same company, same infrastructure, same quality - just a new name. All existing accounts, proxies, and services transferred seamlessly. The pricing and features remain identical, so if you see references to either name, you're looking at the same service.
